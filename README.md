# NodeJS_AsyncAwait_Assignment

You can use async and await instead of chaining .then promises. 

You simply put async before name of the function and use await keyword before operations in this function that would otherweise be executed asynchronous. 

It functions as if you put code after the async operation in a .then( ) promise.
